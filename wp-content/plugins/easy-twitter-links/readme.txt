== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the plugin options page? =

This plugin is all automatic, there are no options to configure!

= Will these links "leak" my PR? =

No. The links that are generated use `rel="nofollow"` in the markup. The generated links also use `target="_blank"` so that you won't be sending users away from your site when they click each link.

= I’m a Wordpress theme developer, and I’d like to bundle your plugin with my themes. Is this okay? =

Absolutely! Please just let me know where the themes will be released so that I can post about it on my site as well!

= I’ve found a bug, where do I report it? =

You can email me via the [contact form](http://eight7teen.com/contact "Contact Form") located on my site
