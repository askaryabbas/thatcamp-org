10:19 < epistemographer> just imagine if we were all piling on one collaborative spreadsheet
10:19 < asolove> so can whoever controls thatcampbot consider the room-specific IRC channels?
10:19 < thatcampbot> ok
10:20 < jgsmith> a wiki page for the schedule?

10:43 < willynills> according sean: three aspects of text mining:  locating or finding documents,  automatically extracting data from documents (instead of manually reading), analysis of corpus

10:51 < elli> RDF: used to define relationships in restricted domains, perhaps more interesting. But movement in developing it is to make it applicable to broader and broader domains.
10:52 < bess_> davelester: I set up thatcampbot to record the channel. I'll give you the logs afterwards.
10:52 < davelester> thanks bess_ :)

11:10 < willynills> text mining does more than speed up historical thought; it should give us a new level of comprehension
11:11 < clioweb> FYI  - I updated the schedule, so that should be current based on the last change we tried to implement downstairs

22:24 < bess_> It's an interface I worked on while at U of Alberta. 
22:24 < bess_> Stan Ruecker was the primary investigator, and if you don't know his work you might also enjoy it... http://www.ualberta.ca/~sruecker/
22:24 < karindalziel> cool- thanks! Something to read ont he plane ride home. :)
22:26 < karindalziel> Are you leading any discussions tomorrow?
22:26 < bess_> no, I don't think so
22:26 < bess_> I plan to be an "active participant" in the omeka one, though! 
22:27 < karindalziel> I can't decide betwen that and interface design. So many tough choices.

22:30 < karindalziel> Hopefully people will blog their sessions/
22:30 < bess_> but GIS, interface design, omeka, and bibliographic standards... I'm working on every one of those right now. :(
22:31 < karindalziel> I will go to management since it pertains most to my job. Unless I change my mind tomorrow morning.

10:09 < asolove> text session has been interesting
10:10 < bess__> mashup session is fascinating. 
10:10 < asolove> what was covered?
10:10 < elli> what was covered in text?
10:10 < asolove> just using Yahoo/Google/Simile tools, or something additional?
10:11 < elli> mashups talked more about APIs, permanence and guidelines for APIs, and not so much about tools and implementations.
10:11 < asolove> uh huh
10:11 < asolove> we discussed some uses and issues with TEI, alternate storage formats 
10:11 < elli> (importance of spending the time to develop APIs and make available)
10:12 < asolove> and cool graphical interfaces for creating digital texts without knowing XML
10:12 < elli> what alternate storage formats
10:12 < asolove> very interesting
10:13 < bess__> asolove: we're talking about everything from google maps, to library of congress web services, to the importance of permanent urls and the implications for scholarship
10:14 < bess__> excellent conversation, I'm generating way more ideas than I'll possibly be able to implement
10:14 < asolove> sounds very interesting, sorry I had to present this round
10:15 < bess__> asolove: I get the feeling there will be lots of blog posts and writeups about this one

11:05 < dancohen> in the interface design session (rm 401) we're debating how much to ask users what a good UI is for a tool or collection
11:07 < jgsmith> re ui: unix tends to optimize for the most common use case, which is the experienced user -- explains why man pages tend to be cryptic for those unfamiliar with a particular command
11:08 < dancohen> jgsmith: right. good point.
11:10 < bess_> in the omeka hacking talk we're making unreasonable demands of the omeka dev team
11:10 < davelester___> :)
11:11 < dchud> jgsmith: does unix optimize for the most common use case, or the simplest, decomposed, filterable use case?
11:11 < asolove> it optimizes for the case of people who have write access to the man page in a project
11:11 < bess_> asolove++ # so true!
11:12 < jgsmith> well, most people using unix are experienced in unix -- the inexperience period is short compared to the rest of a person's career
11:12 < matthewgaventa> nice parallel: in bibliography, we're bordering on making unreasonable demands on the zotero team
11:12 < bess_> matthewgaventa: I'm going to make my unreasonable demands during the lunchtime zotero session
11:13 < jgsmith> doesn't mean an interface should be poorly designed -- but designed for the person familiar with the process or the concepts involved
11:13 < asolove> the design might encourage users to learn the underlying system
11:14 < jgsmith> asolove: -nod- -- easier to do in a GUI than a CLI
11:15 < dancohen> note to people making unreasonable demands of CHNMers: don't make us release the hounds on you.
